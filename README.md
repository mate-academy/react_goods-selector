# React Goods Selector
You are given an array of goods. Render them as a list with ability to select one and change the selection.

1. Write everything inside the `App` (**DON'T** create additional components).
1. Save a `selectedGood` in the `App` (`Jam` is the default value).
1. Show the name of the selected good in `App__title` like this `Jam is selected`.
1. The selected good should be highlighted in the list (add a CSS class `Good--active`).
1. Add a `Clear` button next to the title to clear the selection (set and empty string `''`).
1. The `Clear` button should be visible only if some good is selected.
1. When there is no selected good the title should show `No goods selected`.
1. Add a `Select` button next to each good in the list. When you press it the good becomes selected. (Only 1 good can de selected at a time)
1. Don't show a `Select` button next to the selected good.
1. Add a `Remove` button next to the selected good in the list. When you press it the good becomes not selected.

## (*) Advanced task (optional)

1. Implement the ability to select `multiple goods` (use `selectedGoods` Array)
2. Use functional `setState` described in the next lesson **Functional setState**
3. All the selected goods should be listed in the `h1`:
    - `No goods selected`
    - `Jam is selected`
    - `Carrot, Jam and Eggs are selected`
4. Add some styles, you are frontend developer :) (use [Bulma](https://bulma.io) or another library)
 - [Center elements](https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/level/)
 - [Customize buttons](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/button/)
 - [Customize background](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/colors/)
 - [Add whatever you want](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
