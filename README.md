# React Goods selector
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://VinnieJ-2k20.github.io/react_goods-selector/)
- Follow the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline)

## Task
- DON'T create an additional component for the `GoodsList`, just iterate it in the `App`
- Render a header (`h1`) initially saying `Selected good: -`
- Render a list of goods.
- Add a `Select` button next to each good in the list.
- Add a special class to the selected good  in the list (e.g. highlight it with a yellow color).
- The header should show the name of the selected good.
- Add clear button (`X`) next to the header to clear the selection

## (* Optional) Advanced task
- Implement the ability to select multiple goods (use selectedGoods Array)
- Use functional setState described in [this video](https://youtu.be/zMe2Qq-ThpM)
- Replace `Select` buttons with `Add/Remove`
- All the selected goods should be listed in the header separated with commas.
